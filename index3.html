        in software development, as it ensures that programs
        Coding is the process of building the structure and adding style to websites, making them both functional and
        visually appealing. Through languages like HTML, developers create the framework of a webpage, while CSS is used
        to design and style its appearance with colors, layouts, and fonts. JavaScript then brings interactivity,
        allowing users to engage with dynamic features such as animations, forms, and menus. Together, these elements
        transform a simple idea into a complete digital experience, showing how coding is the foundation of modern web
        development.</p>
